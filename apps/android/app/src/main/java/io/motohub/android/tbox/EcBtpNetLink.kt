/**
 * Gets a dashboard onto a network over Bluetooth, for the dashboards that have no other way on.
 *
 * A Zontes S350 - and every other dash that prints the opaque `CARBIT` + 12 hex QR and then sits
 * there - never brings up an access point, never answers a Wi-Fi Direct scan, and never shows the
 * rider any credentials to type. The official app does not do anything cleverer over Wi-Fi; it
 * talks to the dash over BLE first, hosts a network of its own, and hands the credentials across.
 * That exchange is [EcBtpNetProtocol]; this is the link it runs on.
 *
 * Order matters and is the reason this is safe to try from a fallback path: nothing is created
 * until a dash has been found, has identified itself as speaking the build-net protocol, and has
 * *asked* for a phone-hosted network. A rider who merely forgot to turn their hotspot on never
 * gets a hotspot started behind their back, because no dash ever asked for one.
 *
 * Once provisioning succeeds the link stays open for the session. The dash keeps using it - the
 * clock requests [EcBtpProtocol] already answers arrive here too - and dropping it is what tells
 * the dash the phone is gone.
