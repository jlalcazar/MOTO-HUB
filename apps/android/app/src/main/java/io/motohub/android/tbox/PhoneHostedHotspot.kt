/**
 * A hotspot the app itself brings up, with credentials the app can read.
 *
 * This is the piece that makes [EcBtpNetProtocol]'s build-net exchange possible. Android has never
 * let a third-party app create a hotspot with *dictated* credentials - which is why
 * [io.motohub.android.session.TBoxConnectionMode.PHONE_HOTSPOT] asks the rider to type what their
 * dash prints - but `startLocalOnlyHotspot` is the other half of that rule: the framework picks
 * the SSID and passphrase and hands them to the app that asked. Useless when the dash dictates,
 * exactly right when the dash will accept whatever it is told over Bluetooth.
 *
 * Two behaviours are worth knowing before reading a field log:
 *
 *  * The hotspot lives as long as the reservation is held. Dropping it - including by the process
 *    dying - takes the network down and the dash with it, so [close] is the session's job, not a
 *    detail of the connect.
 *  * Starting it takes the Wi-Fi station radio down on most phones. That is not a fault to work
 *    around; it is what a dash that joins the phone needs, and it is why the connect gate must
 *    not ask "is Wi-Fi on" on this path.
