/**
 * Says whether a VPN is actually standing between this app and the dash - and refuses to say so
 * when it is not.
 *
 * This used to blame the VPN for any failure that happened while a VpnService-based app merely
 * existed on the phone, on the strength of a `TRANSPORT_VPN` network being present. A rider
 * running Tailscale was told to "disable Always-on VPN / Block connections without VPN" - two
 * settings he did not have on - for a failure whose real shape (an exit node capturing the
 * default route) that sentence never named. Presence is not causation, and a diagnosis that
 * sends a rider to the wrong settings screen is worse than no diagnosis.
 *
 * So the evidence is gathered instead of assumed. A VPN that applies to this app is visible in
 * `allNetworks`, and its [android.net.LinkProperties] - readable with ordinary ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE -
 * carry the routes it claims. If those routes cover the dash, the VPN wins the route to it and
 * the diagnosis is a fact; if they do not, the VPN is a bystander and this says nothing.
