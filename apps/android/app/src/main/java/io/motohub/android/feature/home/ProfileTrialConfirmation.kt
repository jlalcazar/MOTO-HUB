 * Asked the moment a profile the rider picked is proven to work - and nowhere else.
 *
 * The timing is the substance of it. Riders are asked to share diagnostics when something is
 * broken, which is exactly when they are frustrated, in a hurry, and have least reason to trust
 * the app with anything. This asks in the one moment the app has just done something for them,
 * about the one fact the collector cannot obtain any other way: WHICH profile works on WHICH
 * dashboard. Rider 315e0af3 found that answer alone and it stayed on his phone; nobody with the
 * same motorcycle benefited.
 *
 * Keeping the profile and sharing the log are separate answers on purpose. Bundling them would
 * make "no thanks" cost the rider the fix they just found, which is not consent.
