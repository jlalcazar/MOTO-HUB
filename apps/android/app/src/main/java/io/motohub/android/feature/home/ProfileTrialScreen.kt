/**
 * The screen a rider reaches from "the dashboard is not showing this" - the thing rider 315e0af3
 * needed and found by accident, two days late, in the Garage.
 *
 * It is not the Garage's override list with a different title. That one is a flat nineteen
 * entries in table order, real motorcycles interleaved with one-question experiments, and no way
 * to tell which could possibly apply to the dash in front of you. Here the ordering carries the
 * app's own evidence (see [ProfileSuggestions]) and every row says why it is being offered, so
 * the rider is choosing between explanations rather than guessing from a menu.
