 * Guesses a level for a message written by code that has none (the ported AAP stack).
 *
 * Deliberately conservative about ERROR: a word matcher cannot tell a fault from a line that
 * merely counts faults, so anything reporting a zero count, or an ordinary socket teardown,
 * stays below ERROR. Callers must not report the result to telemetry either way - see
 * [ProjectionEventLog.external].
 *
 * Guessing is the fallback, not the first move. [io.motohub.android.aa.AaLog] routes every level
 * through `Log.i` and carries the author's own level as a `W: `/`E: ` text marker instead
 * ([io.motohub.android.aa.AaLog.w]) - so the whole ported AA receiver, the largest subsystem in
 * the app, could not produce a single WARNING or ERROR record while this function classified by
 * keyword alone. `W: AapVideo: Dropped Flag 11` came out WARNING by luck (it says "dropped");
 * `W: Decoder stall detected` came out INFO. Rider 4d8a4c5b's log (2026-08-26) has the video path
 * collapsing to 2fps with seven forced decoder restarts, and the console read it as zero errors,
 * zero warnings - invisible to the badges, the needs-attention filter and the cross-rider
 * grouping that exist to surface exactly that.
 *
 * The marker wins over the keywords, but the two rules below can still demote it: they encode
 * faults that were observed to be false, and an author's `E:` on a socket the rider just closed
 * is as wrong as a word matcher's.
