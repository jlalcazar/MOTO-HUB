/**
 * Reports why previous processes of this app ended, on the launch that follows.
 *
 * The complement to [CrashRecovery], which can only describe a death that came with an uncaught
 * exception. The deaths that hurt most in the field are the silent ones: the process is gone, the
 * TFT goes dark mid-ride, and every layer above reports it in its own vocabulary - "the T-Box
 * ended Android Auto", "the session no longer accepts video frames", a Wi-Fi association that
 * dies at full signal - none of which says that the app simply stopped existing.
 *
 * That is what happened on 2026-07-30 (OnePlus, 1.1.24): the companion process was killed 26
 * minutes into a Ride Dashboard session with no Java crash, no native crash and no ANR anywhere
 * in Sentry, which left "why" unanswerable from any log we had. Android knew all along -
 * [ActivityManager.getHistoricalProcessExitReasons] keeps the record - we just never asked.
 *
 * This is the right instrument for a failure that needs a motorcycle and twenty-five minutes to
 * reproduce: it needs nobody attached to the phone, nothing running, and no reproduction at all.
 * Android keeps the history across app updates, so the first launch after installing this reports
 * deaths that happened before it existed.
 *
 * Read the reason with care in one respect: OEM "app management" on phones that are aggressive
 * about background processes frequently reports a kill as `USER_REQUESTED` or `OTHER` rather than
 * `LOW_MEMORY`, so a low-memory death is not always labelled as one. The PSS/RSS figures printed
 * alongside are what distinguishes them.
