# MOTO-HUB - Documentation

Status: active project documentation
Last updated: 9 October 2026

MOTO-HUB is an Android app that connects to a motorcycle T-Box and can stream
screen mirroring or Android Auto to the motorcycle TFT. It also provides a USB
external display mode, local diagnostics, handlebar-control mapping, and GitHub
APK update checks. The Ride Dashboard, navigation and trip recording belong to
MOTO-HUB ADV-SOLO, a separate app, and are not part of this repository. The
macOS T-Box simulator that some documents refer to is kept privately.

This folder is the source of truth for the product to be built. The repositories
in `external upstream repositories` are technical references and are not the
final app.

## Reference Repositories

- `https://github.com/vincenzobpt/ridedaemon-lib`: Go implementation of the
  EasyConn/T-Box protocol and Android-exportable APIs through `gomobile`.
- `https://github.com/charliecharlieO-o/ridedaemon-android`: Kotlin/Compose
  sample app that provisions Wi-Fi, discovers the T-Box, creates a
  `MobileSession`, encodes a synthetic scene and sends frames.

## Terminology

- **HUB**: the new Android app.
- **T-Box / HU / HUD**: EasyConn unit connected to the motorcycle TFT display.
- **Pairing**: in the product, provisioning and connection to the T-Box Wi-Fi
  network. BLE pairing is a separate channel and is not required for MVP video
  streaming.
- **Projection**: an Android `MediaProjection` session authorized by the user.
- **Source**: the complete display or a single app selected in the system picker.
- **Session**: the interval from consent and connection through complete stop.
- **Full Android Auto**: the standalone Android Auto mode. It owns the TFT
  stream and replaces the entire usable T-Box projection area.
- **Embedded Android Auto**: the Ride Dashboard map-region source. It uses the
  same local AAP receiver architecture but is composited into the dashboard.
- **TFT safe margins**: per-motorcycle pixels excluded because the motorcycle
  UI owns them. MOTO-HUB uses them for Android Auto video and touch mapping.

## Documentation Rules

- A feature not tested on a motorcycle must be marked `To validate`.
- Implemented functionality is listed in `../features.md`; code details belong
  in `ANDROID_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
- The ADR decision log and the product requirements are kept privately and are
  not part of this repository.
- Video values confirmed by tests must also be updated in
  `TBOX_STREAMING_CONTRACT.md`.
- GitHub publication is manual unless explicitly stated otherwise. Do not
  assume that source publication and APK publication happen together.
